<p>A <strong>library</strong> performs very detailed, specific operations while a <strong>framework</strong> is a skeleton for you to use. Youâ€™ll still need to fill up the meat on that.</p>

<h3 id="think-about-it-this-way">Think about it this way:</h3>
<p>You utilize libraries for reusable code/components. On the other hand, frameworks need you to fill out with our code. Frameworks make it so that you donâ€™t have to worry about structuring your app, instead, you can focus on implementing components/functions that your app needs.</p>

<h3 id="the-biggest-difference-between-then-would-be-inversion-of-control">The biggest difference between then would be Inversion of Control:</h3>
<p>When you use a library, youâ€™re in control. But when you use a framework, the control is inverted, the framework calls you. Check out this <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html">blog</a> if you want to learn more!</p>

<p>Hopefully, that clears the air of the confusion between the two!  ðŸ˜„<br />
