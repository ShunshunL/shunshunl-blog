<p>Long answer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When script calls a function, the function gets add to the call stack.</li>
  <li>Any functions that get called by the previous function gets added on top of the call stack.</li>
  <li>It starts executing the functions, after executing, the function is taken off the stack and it keeps executing through the stack.</li>
  <li>If the stack takes more space than it had assigned to it =&gt; <strong>Stack Overflow!</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully that was informative!  üòÅ<br />
