<h2 id="an-introduction-to-lambda">An Introduction to Lambda</h2>

<p>A <strong>lambda</strong> is a way to define a block and parameters with ‚Äú= -&gt;‚Äù syntax.</p>

<p>Interestingly, defining a lambda won‚Äôt run the code inside, you have to use the <strong>call</strong> method.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For example:</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="n">my_lambda</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"This is a lambda"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">my_lambda</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">call</span>

  <span class="c1"># "This is a lambda"</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="lambda-can-also-take-arguments">Lambda can also take arguments:</h3>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  <span class="n">divides_by_two</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mf">2.0</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">divides_by_two</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="c1"># 2.5</span></code></pre></figure>

üòé Very cool. I just found a new way to type less üòè</p>

<p>There are also <strong>yield</strong> and <strong>proc</strong> that I want to investigate more but I‚Äôll leave that for a future date for easier digestion.</p>
