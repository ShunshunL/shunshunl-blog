<h3 id="different-areas-of-improvement">Different areas of improvement</h3>

<h4 id="self-care">Self-care:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Be mindful while showering: take a few mindful breaths while waiting for your conditioner/hair mask to work their “magic”</li>
  <li>Take a few minutes of break and do some jumping jacks/burpees to get your blood pumping</li>
  <li>Get pre-prepared meal service delivered so that you can still eat nutritious meals even though you have no time to cook</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="automate-your-life">Automate your life:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Get a wireless charging pad for your phone if you’re the type of person like me where you forget to plug in your phone at night</li>
  <li>Have reminders set for things you don’t want to clutter your brains with</li>
  <li>Have a work timer so that you can take breaks promptly</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="personal-activities">Personal activities:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Take day trips or half-day trips on weekends to get outside and breath fresh air</li>
  <li>Premack principle: Anything that you want to do more can reward anything you want to do less. Take advantage that any type of break will feel like a reward while you’re working hard. I get so excited going to pick up food now while before I would think that’s a chore.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Most of us at some point in our lives have to work long hours for periods of time. This will come with an opportunity cost, but we can minimize the cost by utilizing modern tools and mindfulness. Perception is important. The stress we feel like we can cope with is much better than the stress that we feel like we can’t cope with.</p>

<p>Hope this article about stress management can help you as much as it helped me! <br />
