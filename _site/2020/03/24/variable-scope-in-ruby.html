          <p>I had this question in my head today when I was coding up my first CLI application: What variable do I need based on the scope needed?</p>

<p><em>The narrowest the better. Right?</em></p>

<p>But what are some examples that would make this theory more actionable?</p>

<h3 id="local-variable-scope">Local Variable Scope</h3>

<p>This have the narrowest scope:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>a = 50

def money 
  a = 80 
  puts a #This will return 80
end 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Local variable</strong> basically means it won’t look at outside the method. When the method finishes executing, you won’t be able to access the variables inside anymore.</p>

<h3 id="instance-variable-scope">Instance Variable Scope</h3>

<p>This have a wider scope:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Money 
  def more_money 
    @quantity = 80 
  end 

  def less_money 
    @quantity = 50 
  end 
end 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <strong>@quantity</strong> is shared between both methods.</p>

<p>Essentially, @quantity is only living in this class.</p>

<h3 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h3>

<p>This is the most confusing part for me to understand, but I’ll try to keep it short.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local variables created in the blocks are not avaliable outside them.</li>
  <li>Variables created outside the blocks can be accessed within the blocks.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
