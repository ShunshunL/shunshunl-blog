          <p>I had this question in my head today when I was coding up my first CLI application: What variable do I need based on the scope needed?</p>

<p><em>The narrowest the better. Right?</em></p>

<p>But what are some examples that would make this theory more actionable?</p>

<h3 id="local-variable-scope">Local Variable Scope</h3>

<p>This have the narrowest scope:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">50</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">money</span> 
  <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">80</span> 
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="c1">#This will return 80</span>
<span class="k">end</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Local variable</strong> basically means it won’t look at outside the method. When the method finishes executing, you won’t be able to access the variables inside anymore.</p>

<h3 id="instance-variable-scope">Instance Variable Scope</h3>

<p>This have a wider scope:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Money</span> 
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">more_money</span> 
    <span class="vi">@quantity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">80</span> 
  <span class="k">end</span> 

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">less_money</span> 
    <span class="vi">@quantity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">50</span> 
  <span class="k">end</span> 
<span class="k">end</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, <code class="highlighter-rouge">@quantity</code> is shared between both methods.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code class="highlighter-rouge">@quantity</code> is only living in this class.</p>

<h3 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Local variables created in the blocks are not avaliable outside them.</li>
  <li>Variables created outside the blocks can be accessed and overridden within the blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I understood more about scopes after writing this blog. It solidified some of my disconnected knowledge pieces. Everything seems pretty intuitive now. Hope that was useful to you as well.</p>
