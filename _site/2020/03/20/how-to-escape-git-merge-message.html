<p><strong>If you want to enter your own merge message you need to follow these two steps before the next:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Press ‘i’ on your keyboard</li>
  <li>Write your merge message</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If you want to skip the merge message or you are finished writing your own merge message:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Press ‘esc’ (escape)</li>
  <li>Write “:wq”</li>
  <li>Then hit ‘enter’</li>
</ol>
