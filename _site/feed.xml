I’m Shunshun. This is my blog that I just created. I made it with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. And it was really fun! I think the main reason I’m writing this blog would be because I want to solidify my learning and maybe people could find it helpful to their journey through software developing too. I’m going to write each blog post of mine with a specific topic related to what I had learned that day/week. This way, everything will be organized and easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading my first post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And when I did, this happened:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/merge_message.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the terminal&quot; /&gt;
I had never seen this before and I tried to type q/quit/enter. None of them worked. I turned to my good friend Google and googled around for a bit. And I realized it’s a process to escape this state. Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to enter your own merge message you need to follow these two steps before the next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘i’ on your keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write your merge message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to skip the merge message or you are finished writing your own merge message:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘esc’ (escape)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write “:wq”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then hit ‘enter’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope that was informative and help solved your issue! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
