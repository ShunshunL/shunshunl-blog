Not going to lie, the reason was that it has a very funny name. I decided to do some investigation to get to know it a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-lambda&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Lambda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;lambda&lt;/strong&gt; is a way to define a block and parameters with “= -&amp;gt;” syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, defining a lambda won’t run the code inside, you have to use the &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;my_lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;This is a lambda&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;my_lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# &quot;This is a lambda&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lambda-can-also-take-arguments&quot;&gt;Lambda can also take arguments:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;divides_by_two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;divides_by_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 2.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
😎 Very cool. I just found a new way to type less 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also &lt;strong&gt;yield&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;proc&lt;/strong&gt; that I want to investigate more but I’ll leave that for a future date for easier digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt tired and exhausted by the end of the week. I want to micro improve my life so that I can cope with it better because coding from the time you get up till you go to sleep seems like it’s destroying my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-areas-of-improvement&quot;&gt;Different areas of improvement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;self-care&quot;&gt;Self-care:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be mindful while showering: take a few mindful breaths while waiting for your conditioner/hair mask to work their “magic”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a few minutes of break and do some jumping jacks/burpees to get your blood pumping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get pre-prepared meal service delivered so that you can still eat nutritious meals even though you have no time to cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automate-your-life&quot;&gt;Automate your life:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a wireless charging pad for your phone if you’re the type of person like me where you forget to plug in your phone at night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have reminders set for things you don’t want to clutter your mind with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a work timer so that you can take breaks promptly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-activities&quot;&gt;Personal activities:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take day trips or half-day trips on weekends to get outside and breath fresh air&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Premack principle: Anything that you want to do more can reward anything you want to do less. Take advantage that any type of break will feel like a reward while you’re working hard. I get so excited going to pick up food now while before I would think that’s a chore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us at some point in our lives have to work long hours for periods of time. This will come with an opportunity cost, but we can minimize the cost by utilizing modern tools and mindfulness. Perception is important. The stress we feel like we can cope with is much better than the stress that we feel like we can’t cope with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this article about stress management can help you as much as it helped me! &lt;br /&gt;

It’s a hilarious app that gives you facts about Chuck Norris. It’s a little inappropriate/offensive sometimes but mostly it will surprise you with bursts of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/chucknorrisapp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had so much fun during the process! I loved seeing the final result of my app even though it’s a simple CLI app. I tried my best to utilize different utilities to make my app look as good as possible. I used Ruby and SQLite3 as front and back end managing. Used REST Client to GET data from the Chuck Norris API. And I used ActiveRecord to manage model relationship in my database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the process, I was typing out a lot of if-else statements because I wanted to avoid bugs that appear when users enter the wrong answer. I was like: is there a better way to do this? There’s gotta be a better way. So I googled around and sure enough, there’s a gem that solved my problem and more. I used this gem &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt&quot;&gt;TTY::Prompt&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions in order to make the experience more seamless. It offers select and select_multiple so that the user doesn’t even have to type their answers out. It’s a great gem for building out a CLI app. You can also use it to customize your colors and mask passwords. It solved a lot of problems I would’ve had a hard time going around later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got stuck on the ActiveRecord model relationships. It was a very complicated relationship. I eventually got it working after changing multiple times how my models connect. Now I can say with confidence that I understand how the basics of these ActiveRecord relationships work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learned how to make a demo video of my app using QuickTime and Spark Video which is a pretty cool thing in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my demo video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSXT3-0okXE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about making more apps of my own! Hopefully, this was fun to read and watch :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The narrowest the better. Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are some examples that would make this theory more actionable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-variable-scope&quot;&gt;Local Variable Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This have the narrowest scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#This will return 80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local variable&lt;/strong&gt; basically means it won’t look at outside the method. When the method finishes executing, you won’t be able to access the variables inside anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-variable-scope&quot;&gt;Instance Variable Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This have a wider scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;more_money&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;less_money&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/code&gt; is shared between both methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/code&gt; is only living in this class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-scope&quot;&gt;Block Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local variables created in the blocks are not avaliable outside them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variables created outside the blocks can be accessed and overridden within the blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I understood more about scopes after writing this blog. It solidified some of my disconnected knowledge pieces. Everything seems pretty intuitive now. Hope that was useful to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

And when I did, this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/merge_message.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the terminal&quot; /&gt;
I had never seen this before and I tried to type q/quit/enter. None of them worked. I turned to my good friend Google and googled around for a bit. And I realized it’s a process to escape this state. Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to enter your own merge message you need to follow these two steps before the next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘i’ on your keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write your merge message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to skip the merge message or you are finished writing your own merge message:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘esc’ (escape)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write “:wq”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then hit ‘enter’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope that was informative and help solved your issue! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
