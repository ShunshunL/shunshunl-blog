It’s a hilarious app that gives you facts about Chuck Norris. It’s a little inappropriate/offensive sometimes but mostly it will surprise you with bursts of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/chucknorrisapp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had so much fun during the process! I loved seeing the final result of my app even though it’s a simple CLI app. I tried my best to utilize different utilities to make my app look as good as possible. I used Ruby and SQLite3 as front and back end managing. Used REST Client to GET data from the Chuck Norris API. And I used ActiveRecord to manage model relationship in my database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the process, I was typing out a lot of if-else statements because I wanted to avoid bugs that appear when users enter the wrong answer. I was like: is there a better way to do this? There’s gotta be a better way. So I googled around and sure enough, there’s a gem that solved my problem and more. I used this gem &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt&quot;&gt;TTY::Prompt&lt;/a&gt; to ask questions in order to make the experience more seamless. It offers select and select_multiple so that the user doesn’t even have to type their answers out. It’s a great gem for building out a CLI app. You can also use it to customize your colors and mask passwords. It solved a lot of problems I would’ve had a hard time going around later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got stuck on the ActiveRecord model relationships. It was a very complicated relationship. I eventually got it working after changing multiple times how my models connect. Now I can say with confidence that I understand how the basics of these ActiveRecord relationships work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I learned how to make a demo video of my app using QuickTime and Spark Video which is a pretty cool thing in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my demo video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about making more apps of my own! Hopefully, this was fun to read and watch :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The narrowest the better. Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are some examples that would make this theory more actionable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-variable-scope&quot;&gt;Local Variable Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This have the narrowest scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#This will return 80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local variable&lt;/strong&gt; basically means it won’t look at outside the method. When the method finishes executing, you won’t be able to access the variables inside anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-variable-scope&quot;&gt;Instance Variable Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This have a wider scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;more_money&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;less_money&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/code&gt; is shared between both methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@quantity&lt;/code&gt; is only living in this class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-scope&quot;&gt;Block Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local variables created in the blocks are not avaliable outside them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variables created outside the blocks can be accessed and overridden within the blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I understood more about scopes after writing this blog. It solidified some of my disconnected knowledge pieces. Everything seems pretty intuitive now. Hope that was useful to you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m Shunshun. This is my blog that I just created. I made it with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. And it was really fun! I think the main reason I’m writing this blog would be because I want to solidify my learning and maybe people could find it helpful to their journey through software developing too. I’m going to write each blog post of mine with a specific topic related to what I had learned that day/week. This way, everything will be organized and easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading my first post!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And when I did, this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/merge_message.png&quot; alt=&quot;image of the terminal&quot; /&gt;
I had never seen this before and I tried to type q/quit/enter. None of them worked. I turned to my good friend Google and googled around for a bit. And I realized it’s a process to escape this state. Here’s what I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to enter your own merge message you need to follow these two steps before the next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘i’ on your keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write your merge message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to skip the merge message or you are finished writing your own merge message:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press ‘esc’ (escape)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write “:wq”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then hit ‘enter’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope that was informative and help solved your issue! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
