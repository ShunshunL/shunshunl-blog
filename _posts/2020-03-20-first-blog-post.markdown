Hi! I'm Shunshun. This is my blog that I just created. I made it with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. And it was really fun! I think the main reason I'm writing this blog would be because I want to solidify my learning and maybe people could find it helpful to their journey through software developing too. I'm going to write each blog post of mine with a specific topic related to what I had learned that day/week. This way, everything will be organized and easy to find.

*Thanks for reading my first post!*
