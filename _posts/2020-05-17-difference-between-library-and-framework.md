title: "Difference Between Library and Framework"
---
Sometimes, I feel good about the distinctions between libraries and frameworks. But there are times where I feel hazy about it. I'm writing a blog post here so that I can easily come back if I get hazy again. ðŸ˜‹

A **library** performs very detailed, specific operations while a **framework** is a skeleton for you to use. You'll still need to fill up the meat on that. 

### Think about it this way: 
You utilize libraries for reusable code/components. On the other hand, frameworks need you to fill out with our code. Frameworks make it so that you don't have to worry about structuring your app, instead, you can focus on implementing components/functions that your app needs. 

### The biggest difference between then would be Inversion of Control:
When you use a library, you're in control. But when you use a framework, the control is inverted, the framework calls you. Check out this [blog](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html) if you want to learn more! 

Hopefully, that clears the air of the confusion between the two!  ðŸ˜„
